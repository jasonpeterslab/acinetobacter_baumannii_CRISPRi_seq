470.IX87_11435	IX87_11435	916	Involved in the regulation of glutamine synthetase GlnA, a key enzyme in the process to assimilate ammonia. When cellular nitrogen levels are high, the C-terminal adenylyl transferase (AT) inactivates GlnA by covalent transfer of an adenylyl group from ATP to specific tyrosine residue of GlnA, thus reducing its activity. Conversely, when nitrogen levels are low, the N-terminal adenylyl removase (AR) activates GlnA by removing the adenylyl group by phosphorolysis, increasing its activity. The regulatory region of GlnE binds the signal transduction protein PII (GlnB) which indicates the  [...]

Also deacylates mischarged glycyl-tRNA(Ala), protecting cells against glycine mischarging by AlaRS. Acts via tRNA- based rather than protein-based catalysis; rejects L-amino acids rather than detecting D-amino acids in the active site. By recycling D- aminoacyl-tRNA to D-amino acids and free tRNA molecules, this enzyme counteracts the toxicity associated with the formation of D-aminoacyl- tRNA entities in vivo and helps enforce protein L-homochirality.
