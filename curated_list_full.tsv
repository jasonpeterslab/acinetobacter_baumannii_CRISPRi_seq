N0.HOG0000577	ilvA	GO593_17405	IX87_21040	ilvA	ilvA	Catalyzes the anaerobic formation of alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia from threonine in a two-step reaction. The first step involved a dehydration of threonine and a production of enamine intermediates (aminocrotonate), which tautomerizes to its imine form (iminobutyrate). Both intermediates are unstable and short-lived. The second step is the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the enamine/imine intermediates to form 2- ketobutyrate and free ammonia. In the low water environment of the cell, the second step is accelerated by RidA.

A damage recognition complex composed of 2 UvrA and 2 UvrB subunits scans DNA for abnormalities. Upon binding of the UvrA(2)B(2) complex to a putative damaged site, the DNA wraps around one UvrB monomer. DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision [...]
